This is a guided project available on Udemy, centering around the utilization of Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence. The course extensively covers various aspects, including data connection and transformation, constructing a relational data model, incorporating calculated fields through DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), visualizing data through interactive dashboards, and enhancing Power BI's overall performance.

The primary focus of this project involves the analysis of a comprehensive dataset from AdventureWorks, a global manufacturing company that specializes in the production of cycling equipment and related accessories. This dataset contains valuable information related to transactions, returns, products, customers, and sales territories. Throughout the project, the focus is on monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs), including sales, revenue, profit, and returns, while also conducting regional performance comparisons. Additionally, the project delves into product-level trend analysis and the identification of high-value customers.
