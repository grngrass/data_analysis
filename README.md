## Portfolio Projects Description

### [AdventureWorks](https://github.com/grngrass/data_analysis/blob/main/Power%20BI/AdventureWorks%20Report.pbix)

This is a guided project available on Udemy, centering around the utilization of Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence. The course extensively covers various aspects, including data connection and transformation, constructing a relational data model, incorporating calculated fields through DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), visualizing data through interactive dashboards, and enhancing Power BI's overall performance.

The primary focus of this project involves the analysis of a comprehensive dataset from AdventureWorks, a global manufacturing company that specializes in the production of cycling equipment and related accessories. This dataset contains valuable information related to transactions, returns, products, customers, and sales territories. Throughout the project, the focus is on monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs), including sales, revenue, profit, and returns, while also conducting regional performance comparisons. Additionally, the project delves into product-level trend analysis and the identification of high-value customers. 


### [Chicago Car Crush Dataset and Dashboard](https://github.com/grngrass/data_analysis/blob/main/Excel/Chicago_Car_Crush.md)
The data was sourced from the Chicago data portal, and I performed data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Excel. I narrowed down the dataset to focus on Chicago car crashes that occurred between 2016 and 2022, excluding the years 2013 to 2015 and 2023 from the original source due to limited data availability. It's important to note that this data reduction may impact the comprehensiveness of our analysis.
The primary Key Performance Indicator (KPI) I was tracking is the total number of casualties, which includes both injuries and fatalities. The dataset includes information about accident dates and times, weather conditions, light conditions, road surface conditions, main causes of accidents, and other relevant data. For data analysis, I used pivot tables to summarize and explore the dataset effectively. The goal is to derive actionable insights from the dashboard's visualizations. The dashboard will feature a range of visualizations, including bar charts, and line graphs to present the monthly trend comparisons of casualties across different years, relationships between casualties and light/weather conditions, the primary causes of accidents, crash occurrences on weekdays, and peak crash times during rush hours.
