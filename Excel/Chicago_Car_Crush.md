### [Chicago Car Crush Dataset and Dashboard](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/cazgypf7sn5kn1ywmexvh/Chicago_Car_Crash.xlsx?rlkey=kszd0k7zzb33425gzgjw7emrb&dl=0)

**Description**: 
The data was sourced from the Chicago data portal, and I performed data cleaning, analysis, and visualization using Excel. I narrowed down the dataset to focus on Chicago car crashes that occurred between 2016 and 2022, excluding the years 2013 to 2015 and 2023 from the original source due to limited data availability. It's important to note that this data reduction may impact the comprehensiveness of our analysis.

The primary Key Performance Indicator (KPI) I was tracking is the total number of casualties, which includes both injuries and fatalities. The dataset includes information about accident dates and times, weather conditions, light conditions, road surface conditions, main causes of accidents, and other relevant data. For data analysis, I used pivot tables to summarize and explore the dataset effectively. The goal is to derive actionable insights from the dashboard's visualizations. The dashboard will feature a range of visualizations, including bar charts, and line graphs to present the monthly trend comparisons of casualties across different years, relationships between casualties and light/weather conditions, the primary causes of accidents, crash occurrences on weekdays, and peak crash times during rush hours.
